      These are things that I have considered making or doing, most of which I am independently capable of executing. It is only for lack of temporal and financial luxury that these efforts remain unexplored. Admittedly, any idea that lends itself to ready manifestation is not particularly interesting, but I'm not trying to win any awards here üèÜ

    <h1>Why is everything a Kit?</h1>
    <p>
      More than any one project or idea, I get excited about possibility. Kits embody a spirit of possibility that finished goods do not. The assortment of components that comprise a kit <em>can</em> be assembled into a specified thing, but they can also be repurposed to serve other, more personal, creative, and inventive ends.

        <h1>Voice-changer Microphone Kit</h1>
        <p>
          Design a kit that can be assembled into a hand-held voice-changer microphone (you talk into one end and the processed signal comes out the other) for which the user can create custom audio effects via a web-based interface. The hardware would comprise an enclosure, microphone, speaker, battery holder, buttons, audio amp, and something like an ESP32 for the interface, connectivity and audio processing. It could serve as a fun, gratifying introduction to digital signal processing.

          I called this a deformable (or column) table and imagined using it as a game surface for maniuplating the position of a ball, almost exactly like they do <a href="https://vimeo.com/79179138#t=190s">in the video</a>. Prototyping this was beyond my capabilities at the time.

        <h1>Guitar Effects Platform</h1>
        <p>
          Custom guitar effects pedal platform. Line 6 was doing something like this with their ToneCore DSP product, but it was expensive and prescriptive. The killer feature that I wanted to implement was the ability to clone an existing pedal through automated manipulation of its physical controls in conjunction with input signal generation and target output analysis. Recently, in 2020, there was this <a href="https://teddykoker.com/2020/05/deep-learning-for-guitar-effect-emulation/">Deep Learning for Guitar Effect Emulation</a>.

        <p>
          View is of a meadow with a tree in the far distance and mountains in the background. With each kick drum hit, the camera moves forward toward the tree. Birds fly through the meadow and clouds move in the sky. It is alive. As you approach the tree, an animal standing under the tree becomes visible. It is a horse. It looks nervous as you approach. It‚Äôs mouth is slightly ajar. The kick drum hits move the camera toward the horse‚Äôs mouth. The horse looks very nervous. The camera enters the horse‚Äôs mouth and travels down the throat. Procedurally generated graphics simulate a journey through the horse‚Äôs digestive tract. It‚Äôs a multimedia extravaganza.

Why are there no local game shows? Seems like such an obviously fun thing for folks to attend.

          Players drive RC cars on a road surface game field rendered using laser projectors. Cameras detect car position to register collisions and goal achievement. Lots of room for fun personalization of vehicles using digital fabrication. An exciting, physical, IRL, AR game experience! Good for culdesacs. Just typing this gets me super-excited about it again; I probably shouldn't publish it. $$$
