      These are things that I have considered making or doing, most of which I am independently capable of executing. It is only for lack of temporal and financial luxury that these efforts remain unexplored. Admittedly, any idea that lends itself to ready manifestation is not particularly interesting, but I'm not trying to win any awards here üèÜ

    <h1>Why is everything a Kit?</h1>
    <p>
      More than any one project or idea, I get excited about possibility. Kits embody a spirit of possibility that finished goods do not. The assortment of components that comprise a kit <em>can</em> be assembled into a specified thing, but they can also be repurposed to serve other, more personal, creative, and inventive ends.

        <h1>Voice-changer Microphone Kit</h1>
        <p>
          Design a kit that can be assembled into a hand-held voice-changer microphone (you talk into one end and the processed signal comes out the other) for which the user can create custom audio effects via a web-based interface. The hardware would comprise an enclosure, microphone, speaker, battery holder, buttons, audio amp, and something like an ESP32 for the interface, connectivity and audio processing. It could serve as a fun, gratifying introduction to digital signal processing.

        <h1>Sound Book Kit</h1>
        <p>
          Design a kit that can be assembled into a frame that has audio playback componentry along one side and the ability to affix book pages to the other, providing a means for the reader to create their own interactive experience through the creation of their own pages and audio samples. This could also serve as a platform for playback of stories as read by loved ones. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kids+sound+book&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images">Examples</a>
