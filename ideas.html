              <p itemprop="description">
                Arcade games are an exciting and well-loved manifestation of physical computing, but in constrast to peoples' burgeoning ability to author game software, creating new, exciting, and specific physical interfaces through which to interact with these games remains largely out of reach. This initiative would create a space to teach physical interface design, programming, and fabrication in conjunction with game software design and programming, with the end goal of creating a physical gaming appliance to be presented in an arcade gallery and/or duplicated for sale. Game design instruction will focus on leveraging modern web technologies (e.g. HTML5, Javascript, Web Components) and development practices (e.g. testing, version control) to maximize the potential of applying what is learned in a professional capacity. Hardware design instruction will focus on leveraging modern, inexpensive, commodity components and modular construction practices.

The hardware would comprise an enclosure, microphone, speaker, battery holder, buttons, audio amp, and something like an ESP32 for the interface, connectivity and audio processing. It could serve as a fun, gratifying introduction to digital signal processing. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=voice-changer+microphone&t=h_&iax=images&ia=images">Examples</a>

                I called this a deformable (or column) table and imagined using it as a game surface for maniuplating the position of a ball, almost exactly like they do <a href="https://vimeo.com/79179138#t=190s">in the video</a>. I also considered rounding the column heads and skinning the surface with a sheet of latex to create a more organic form. Prototyping this was beyond my capabilities at the time.

Recently, in 2020, there was this <a href="https://teddykoker.com/2020/05/deep-learning-for-guitar-effect-emulation/">Deep Learning for Guitar Effect Emulation</a>.

Birds fly through the meadow and clouds move in the sky. It is alive. As you approach the tree, an animal standing under the tree becomes visible. It is a horse. It looks nervous as you approach. It’s mouth is slightly ajar. The kick drum hits move the camera toward the horse’s mouth. The horse looks very nervous. The camera enters the horse’s mouth and travels down the throat. Procedurally generated graphics simulate a journey through the horse’s digestive tract. It’s a multimedia extravaganza.

                Based on the trope of a person entering a room, accompanied by an enthralled audience, who delivers a final, out-of-context punchline. Stage is a series of themed rooms arranged in a circle with the protagonist and companions continuously making an entrance from one to the next, delivering ever-changing punchlines. Over time the performers become wary, the jokes become tedious and no longer funny. Maybe things eventually take a violent turn.
